# Contributing

Definition for concept in these rules:

A new concept will be many things, could be a new command never mentionned or difficult to find in the code,
a function used in a novel way or simply something you think could
optimise the code without making it much more difficult to understand compared to before, and again,
new things will be added to this definition with time, this is not a fully fledged or strict definition like in wikipedia.

An old concept would be anything which already has an example in the code
or already elaborated uppon in comments in the code.

Rule 1:

Any and all contribution to this project must be in the goal of facilitating understanding or adding new examples
to new concepts or old within this repo,
in the objective of correcting errors or bad comments in the code.
New things will probably be added to this rule with time.

Rule 2:

If you are to make any sort of change to the code,
make a new branch and make a pull request with the main branch once you have debugged and tested the compiled code.

Rule 3:

Do not remove or modify any comments or code already written without explicit approval from the maintainer (Me presently, Seven0492)
and at least a portion (Will be more specific in the future) of the community (If it exists yet).
