# Projets-programes

This is a script with maybe new scripts in the future coded in C for reference purposes, I puplished it on github because
I wanted to understand github better and share it conveniently with others without pastebin.com.

Plain and direct, or do you prefer poetry?

 // This repo is under a GPL-3.0 license, so i can't sue you if you copy me :P 
 
 // Just you need to give credit to this repo if you just copy the code for whatever reason, even if there is no useful code in there, so I wouldn't know why you would do it in the first place... Full license is in the LICENSE file.
