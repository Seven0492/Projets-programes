# Projets-programes

This is a script with maybe new scripts in the future coded in C for reference purposes, I puplished it on github because
I wanted to understand github better and share it conveniently with others without pastebin.com.

Plain and direct, or do you prefer poetry?

# How to compile

This is simple, you just need to type: make.

After that there is two new files, test.o is garbage, so doing: make clean, will remove it.

There are two other options too, make cleanall, to remove test.exe too,
and make install, with no sudo permissions required, more info in the MAKE.md file.
