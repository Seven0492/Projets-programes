# Projets-programes (Deprecated, I have since switched to Rust, I'm a nomad)

This is a script with maybe new scripts in the future coded in C for reference purposes, I puplished it on github because
I wanted to understand github better and share it conveniently with others without pastebin.com.

Plain and direct, or do you prefer poetry?

# Update

I've recently switched to Python because C is too close to asm(assembly) for me to understand what I'm doing, might come back here again someday

# How to compile

This is simple, you just need to type the command "make" in the source code directory.

After that there is two new files, test.o is garbage, so doing: "make clean", will remove it.

There are two other options too, "make cleanall", to remove test.exe too,
and "make install" (This option will break your terminal, wait until I fix it), with no sudo permissions required, more info in the MAKE.md file.
